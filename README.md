## Description
An HTTP Server for Linux/Unix machines.

This server only takes GET requests.
This server respondes with 200, 400, 404, 418, or 500 responses only.


## Potential Improvements
- Support for POST and HEAD requests,
- logging connections and requests to an external file,
- Command line arguments to serve from a specific directory
- Support for all HTTP responses.
